; the knowledge base. It is a list of 3 elements containing:
; - the list of predicates, as pairs (Predicate-name . no-of-arguments). Predicate names begin with a capital letter
; - the list of functions (currently unused)
; - the list of facts; currently all facts are either predicates or implications
;    - constants begin with a capital, variables begin with a minuscule
;    - predicates are of the form (Predicate-name Predicate-arg-1 Predicate-arg-2 ...)
;    - implications are of the form (implies condition conclusion), where both condition and conclusion can be a single predicate or a conjunction (e.g. (and (American x) (Hostile y)) )
