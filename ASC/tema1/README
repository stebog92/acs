    Assignment 1 - Cluster Activity Simulation
    Computer Systems Architecture course
    Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers, 
    University Politehnica of Bucharest
    march 2013


Description
--------------
Simulation of a computational cluster. The cluster consists of:
* FEP nodes (front-end processors)
* nodes with both computational and storage functionalities

The FEP nodes are implemented by the testing infrastructure (tester.py module).
The computational nodes must be implemented as part of the assignment (node.py 
module).
The data is partitioned and stored in datastore objects (datastore.py module), 
one for each node. A node can access data only from its own datastore, and must 
communicate with other nodes if it needs data from their datastores. 


Usage
-----

Run all the tests using the run_tests script

./run_tests

For generating and running your own tests or random ones, please see the 
documentation, and modify tester.py's main.
