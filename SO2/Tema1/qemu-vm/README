Minimal qemu dev environment, Vlad Dogaru, 21.01.2014

Slightly modified from an earlier version by Octavian PurdilÄƒ.

Dev environment is 32bit, even if host machine is 64bit.


== Required files ==

You need a `bzImage' and a `busybox' in the current directory.  They are
not included in the repo, but there are instructions to build them
below.

For a simple setup, you can get the two files via scp from

	so2@elf.cs.pub.ro:tools/


== To rebuild bzImage ==

Grab kernel_config, stick it in a kernel tree, run

	make

New bzImage will be available in arch/x86/boot/bzImage.  Config is for a
32bit kernel.

Make sure you use the same kernel version as the students, so you'll
probably need to checkout to a tagged revision if you're building from a
git tree.


== To rebuild busybox ==

Grab busybox_config, stick it in a busybox config, run

	LDFLAGS=-m32 make

There is an `extra LDFLAGS' option in busybox, but it does not seem to
work.


== To build modules (homework) ==

Grab kernel_config, stick it in a kernel tree, run

	make prepare

Modules should then have the following line at the top:

	KDIR=/usr/src/linux-so2

This saves students the burdain of having a full kernel tree on their
disk.  Of course, if you have such a tree (e.g. you compiled a bzImage
earlier), you can use that one.

But you might get in trouble if your tree is not at the exact version
students should use (currently tentatively set at 3.13, as it's the most
recent at the time of this writing).


== To put files in the virtual machine ==

Best stick anything you need (modules and test programs) in fsimg/root.

You will need to statically link non-trivial programs.  Additionally,
make sure you specify -m32 when compiling everything except modules
(kernel build system takes care of that).


Direct all questions to the list.
